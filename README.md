# Switching It Up

## Instructions

In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests. Currently the `calculateScore` function returns `0` for unknown positions which is causing the tests to fail. Your task is to rework this function so that it works as expected, making the tests pass.

## Provided Files

**.eslintrc.js** - a config file for eslint

**scoring.js** - this file contains a JavaScript module called scoring with a `calculateScore` function. This function calls all of the other calculation functions to get a total score.

**tests.js** - this file contains tests for the `calculateScore` function in the `scoring` module

**package.json** - this file sets up the Node project including all the dev dependencies

**.gitignore** - this file sets the project up to ignore the node_modules folder when committing to git

## Exercise Submission

You should submit your working changes in a pull request.
